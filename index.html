        <p id="story-text"> You're a cowboy in Hangman's Hollow. You awake one afternoon in your favorite tavern, The Rusty Oak, disoriented and hungover with no recollection of what happened yesterday. Your task is to make it out of the tavern and discover what happened to your town, and make it out alive....if you can.</p>
